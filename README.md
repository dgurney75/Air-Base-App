# AIR Base Mobile Application

The AIR Base Mobile application combines the power of [Adobe Animate CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html) to design custom UI that seemlessly integrates with [ActionScript 3.0](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html) and is published using [Adobe AIR](https://airsdk.harman.com/download) for both Apple and Android devices. This application demos the [Distriqt AIR Native Extensions Library](https://airnativeextensions.com) using common mobile user flows.
